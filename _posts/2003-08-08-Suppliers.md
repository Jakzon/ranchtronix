Info from Jeff H on getting carpet bits:
<pre>
J & M Carpets
1076 40th St  emeryville, ca

The big truck outside is full of carpet and padding remnants.  They fill it
all week, and every Saturday they drive to the dump.  Sign on the door
says:  "Don't Knock, Just Take What You Need".   Very cool.
</pre>

Hill adds:
<pre>
you can get carpets reminants at Floorcraft on Bayshore and Cortland in SF.
There is an area on Cortland where they put all their reminants before sending
them to the dump.  I have gotten some great stuff there.
