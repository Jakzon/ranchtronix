[Tivo Upgrade How-To](http://www.newreleasesvideo.com/hinsdale-how-to/)


I gots da drives at my house with official tivo software on them.  Just need someone to remind me to bring them in before 'tronix.  Plus, need some IDE and drive power cables to hook them up.  I'll bring them on wednesday (if I remember).
