Currently our Tivos ain't got no drives.  So we need to get the OS off another box.

I gots da drives at my house with official tivo software on them.  Just need someone to remind me to bring them in before 'tronix.  Plus, need some IDE and drive power cables to hook them up.  I'll bring them on wednesday (if I remember).

You can record HDTV on any Mac. This is because of an FCC regulation that cable companies provide a Firewire-enabled cable box to anyone who wants one. There is a usually a small monthly fee for the box. [More info here](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040426151111599).
