title: SmashYourComputer
---


Background/context

We have all been frustrated with our computers at some point.  We are dependent on computers in many ways, and when they fail to work properly

* we have all been frustrated
* lack of empowerment when we don't understand the internals
* * but sometimes knowing the insides is even more frustrating
* have had urge to smash the computer
* * destroy the black box
* take the computational power of computer and use it to simulate it's own destruction
* provide the opportunity for a physical expression of frustration against the unfeeling computer
* explore issues of simulated violence
* * does it make us more or less violent?
* * will you smash your computer when you get home?

Audience

* anyone who has been frustrated with their computer

User scenario

* user sees progress meter on screen
* after certain point (or pressure sensor) computer will crash
* user can press reset button to reboot
* at any point, can hit with sledgehammer
* projected image of computer breaks apart depending on force from sledgehammer

Implementation

* custom software written using OpenGL, Open Dynamics Engine for physics simulation
* AVR microcontroller code written using BASCOM-AVR
* beige computer case instrumented with sensors
* projection screen and projector
* plastic/rubber sledgehammer

Conclusion

* provides a safe environment to vent frustration
* cathartic experience
* computational power of computer can be turned against itself
