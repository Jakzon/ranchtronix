We need to order side-emitting fiber.

The only place we've looked so far is [http://www.del-lighting.com/fiber_optic_cable.html](http://www.del-lighting.com/fiber_optic_cable.html)

    i have some side-emitting fiber, ordered from [http://www.thefiberopticstore.com](http://www.thefiberopticstore.com)
    my pal beverly has done projects with it - she says you need a *very* bright
   light source to make it work.  she buys units that use a halogen bulb and
   a color wheel.  leds are not bright enough.
