#REDIRECT [DecouplingCapacitors](DecouplingCapacitors.html)

## Moved to [DecouplingCapacitors](DecouplingCapacitors.html)


Hmmm... I named this page "DecouplingCapacitor" instead of "DecouplingCapacitors", since people on other wikis tend to prefer that pages names be singular rather than plural.

Then I looked at our wiki and realized that we seem to prefer the plural. So [DecouplingCapacitors.](DecouplingCapacitors..html)

Plus, now you don't have to type <code>DecouplingCapacitor""s</code> to get a link to [DecouplingCapacitor""s.](DecouplingCapacitor""s..html) Stupid singular page names....
