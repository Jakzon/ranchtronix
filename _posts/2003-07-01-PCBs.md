## Boards

* Some Eagle [BoardFiles.](BoardFiles..html)

### Places we've tried (please add comments)

* [Custom PCB](http://www.custompcb.com/index.html) - based in Malaysia.  Accepts Eagle .brd files.  Accepts multiple designs in a single order and will depanelize (for a fee, of course).  Fast, cheap, good!  Did an order with 3 designs, double-sided, solder mask both sides.  Total of 24 boards (1"x1.25" each) for about $4 each delivered.  With close traces, they might bleed into each other.  Go as big and widely spaced as you can.
* [AP Circuits](http://www.apcircuits.com/) - based in Alberta.  I've used them before.  Not so cheap but fast and good. (mang)

### Other places

* [Olimex](http://www.olimex.com/pcb/index.html) - single side 6.3" x 3.9" for $21. Based in Bulgaria.
* [Advanced Circuits](http://www.4pcb.com/index.htm)
* [PCBexpress](http://www.pcbexpress.com/)

### Design software

* [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoft.de/freeware.htm) - freeware version
* [gEDA](http://www.geda.seul.org/) - a GPLed electronic design package. Under active development.
* [Osmond PCB](http://www.swcp.com/~jchavez/osmond.html) - for macintosh, free
* Lots of free software listed here: [http://www.opencollector.org/collector.php3](http://www.opencollector.org/collector.php3)

### DIY

* [PCB FAQ](http://members.rotfl.com/dturner/PCBFAQ.htm) - nice tutorial on making your own PCBs
* $40 tank w/heater and agitator [here](http://shop.store.yahoo.com/webtronics/lowcosetsysw.html)

### Stripboard

* Nice example of how to use EagleCAD to design for stripboard [here](http://freespace.virgin.net/seant.ellis/avreval.htm)

### Soldering

* SMT soldering tutorial using an AVR dev board [here](http://www.bdmicro.com/smt/)

### mang's notes to his own bad self

* putting a square pad on pin 1 of headers is good, but a larger rectangle would be better (single row headers only)
* some text (e.g. ADC, Vin) on top side next to headers would be good
* should mark pin 1 on ICs
* with AVR no need to make LEDs negative logic
* 1"x1.25" seems to be a good size for CustomPCB (24 boards in their standard size order)
* surface mount coin cell holders could be a good thing
* SOT-223 voltage regulators look interesting
* make your traces as large and widely spaced as possible
* remember to leave space for mounting holes, if that's your thing
