The tech is reaching new levels of sweetness, and there is plenty of homebrew goin' on.

Linky:

* [FaderFox micromodule](http://www.futuremusic.com/news/december2004/micromodul.html) controllers designed for Ableton Live (but MIDI only, no USB!!!)
* [Behringer B-Control series](http://www.behringer.com/BCR2000/index.cfm?lang=ENG) e.g. BCR2000 with 32 rotary encoders
* [CTRL LIVE](http://www.doepfer.de/controller_example_2.JPG) - Richie Hawtin's custom controller built with boards from Doepfer
* [Some custom thing in an old military box](http://www.vjforums.com/attachment.php?s=76bf36fade08526717647a5c2e4847c2&postid=81160)
