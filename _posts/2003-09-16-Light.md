LEDs are low power, and create gorgeous saturated color.  Love them.

Some projects and thoughts -

* [NightLights](NightLights.html) (better name needed)
* AAA [BatteryBooster.](BatteryBooster..html)
* [Powering LED widgets](Powering_LED_widgets.html)
* Camping disco balls
* [LuxeonLights](LuxeonLights.html)
* Illuminated hats -
* * Collimated luxeons shining vertically thru a cylindrical hat, with mini smoke source a la zero blaster... or even incense??
* * Blacklight shining vertically, into gauze / chinese mystery garnish, spackled with highlighter ink / other fluorescent.

## Supplies

* [http://www.superbrightleds.com](http://www.superbrightleds.com) has been fast/good/cheap.  NOTE they have new 8-degree beam LEDs, but they're no good - they have a lot of side leakage.

* TOO SLOW / TOO EXPENSIVE [http://www.luxeonstar.com/](http://www.luxeonstar.com/) has luxeons - 1-watt LEDs!  They arrived affter nearly a month.    A little cheaper than 15 ordinary superbrights, easier to wire, and a much more concentrated point source.  They aren't blinding except to look at, though...

* BETTER! [http://lumileds.com](http://lumileds.com) is the home site for luxeons; the recommend calling 1-888-luxeon2 to order.  I believe this is Future Electronics.  Cheaper, 60% of the price.  Around $6 for a 1W luxeon with optics.  Much quicker!  Annoyingly, there's no part/availability list on the site; however, they use the same part numbers as luxeonstar.com.

* City Lights Lighting Showroom, 1585 Folsom Street in San Francisco (415-863-2020) has a great selection of weird light bulbs, including colored Compact Fluorescent bulbs.
