If you planned your project properly, you would have bought all your components months ago from Jameco or Digikey. But you fucked up, and you leave for the playa in fourteen hours, and now your stuck at Radio Shack with all the other poor planners and a few assorted idiots. You swear that you'll finish your next project in plenty of time, but month after month, year after year, you find yourself at [RatShack](RatShack.html) wondering why you never learn.

My credit card statement in the last week before BM2002 looked something like this:<br>
July 23 - Radio Shack $80<br>
July 24 - Radio Shack $120<br>
July 24 - Radio Shack $50<br>

But dammit, my 555 timer + relay EL sequencer worked where all else had failed!
