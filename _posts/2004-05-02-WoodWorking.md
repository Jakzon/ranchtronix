* [Make your own dovetail gauge](http://home.comcast.net/~charliebcz/DovetailDrawer17.html) (from [this tutorial](http://home.comcast.net/~charliebcz/DovetailDrawer0.html)).

Stuff to buy for dovetails project:

* Quick clamps (currently using sasha's, thanx!)

* Wood rasp (currently using foo's, thankx!!!)
* Does anyone make chisels smaller than 1/4"????

* [http://www.japanwoodworker.com](http://www.japanwoodworker.com) has a dovetail saw i want!

Things I've learned so far from my practice cuts:

* Saw blades have thickness. I suppose the fact that I'm just now figuring this out indicates how often I work with wood!
* It is easer to make straight accurate cuts in hardwood...
