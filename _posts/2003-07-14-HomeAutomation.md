[HomeAutomation](HomeAutomation.html) always seemed absurdly geeky, but X10 starter kits are absurdly cheap these days. For five minutes, you can make anything into a remote control anything. I bought a [RatShack](RatShack.html) "Plug' npower" system because it was on sale for twenty bucks. Here are some notes:

* X10 is a home automation standard. It has been around since the 70s. [History of X10](http://home.planet.nl/~lhendrix/x10_history.htm)
* X10 starter kits are cheap, and they can be used as a remote control unit for your project.
* X10 systems send data either over 120V powerlines or wirelessly. There are bridge modules to restransmit wireless signals over wired links.

Some notes about dimming lights:

* The choice of bulb seems to matter. 
* Slyvania bulbs are cheap, but make loud buzzing noises when dimmed.
* GE bulbs don't buzz when dimmed.
* Don't plug halogen lamps or fluorescent ballasts into X10 lamp dimmer modules. You need to get a special module that can dim these devices.
