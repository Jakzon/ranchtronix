Desert projector enclosure (courtesy of Sam):

    - plastic storage bin
    - clear plexiglas
    - hot wire to cut hole out of storage bin for light to exit
    - screwed plexiglas onto bin with nut and bolt
    - another hole in plastic storage tub (slightly smaller)
   - flexible vinyl dryer tubing through this hole
   - clean air source (very high flow rate)
    - cracks in top of box is where air exits

Idea:
    - creates positive pressure clean air environment
    - keeps cool
    - filter and fan assembly is far from projector


Box with air filter:
    - HEPA furnace filter
    - taped trash compactor bag on one side, another bag on other side
    - squirrel cage blower to force air through
    - inflates like horrible monster
    - blower is loud, but tolerates lots of backpressure
