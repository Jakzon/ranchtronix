If you had the 9m you'd be out there right now.  You certainly can't cut that corner without a whatchamawhosit jig.  If only you a [YamaRoMoog](YamaRoMoog.html) JX-908 you would be able to make phat ass trax.

Last year's model? That's so last year. Plus, I want it in blue.  It may cost 20x as much at [RatShack,](RatShack,.html) but I need it! Now!

But does it play FLAC? Version 2.3a2 has the better firmware.

Note to self: Get Mang back on his meds.
