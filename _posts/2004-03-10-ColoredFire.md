## Experiments in blowing colored sparkley fire.

I've been blowing fire with pyrotechnic chemicals (for color) and metal powders (for sparkle.)

## Inspirations

My friend Foo made a pneumatic flame projector, ['Betsy'](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/ranchfire/IMG_1546.vhtml).  The first few fires were with gasoline, but he really caught my attention when he fired a [giant fireball](http://www.cloudfactory.org/~catweasel/bm01/Fire/pages/P9030208.htm) of methyl alcohol and strontium chloride.  It lit up the area with saturated road-flare red for hundreds of yards around.  He's started some notes, under [PyroExMachina.](PyroExMachina..html)

## Chemicals

Some links on health information.  In reading each of the following, I figure on absorbing only a small number of milligrams orally; consider that normal doses of lithium carbonate (for bipolar mania) are on the order of 1-2 <b>grams</b> per day.  (No swallowing!)  I am mostly concerned about problems with chronic doses.


Here's a <b>great</b> government resource for toxicity summaries - ['ATSDR'](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/).  Much easier to read than MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) which are usually almost entirely boilerplate.

[Mineral Tolerance of Domestic Animals.](http://books.nap.edu/books/0309030226/html/index.html)

* Strontium chloride - road-flare red
* * [Great overview.](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs159.html)
* * [Integration of strontium into hydroxypatite (bone)](http://www.whitworth.edu/Academic/Department/Chemistry/Classes/ch494/tonyb/research.htm)
* * [Park Service on Strontium](http://www.nature.nps.gov/hazardssafety/toxic//strontiu.pdf)
* * [Government fact sheet on Strontium](http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/strontium.pdf) Mostly Strontium-90, the radioactive isotope everyone's heard about.  But this is *only* due to man-made nuclear reactions; it has a half-life of 29 years and doesn't occur naturally.
* * Is it an ingredient in Sensodyne toothpaste?  Maybe it's [good for you??](http://www.smithsfoodanddrug.com/HN_Supp/Strontium.htm)
* Boric Acid - pale green

* * [Megadosing mice](http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/htdocs/LT-studies/tr324.html)
* Calcium chloride - tangerine
* * [Biology of calcium.](http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1985/7/85.07.08.x.html#e)  This is also relevant to strontium, which is biologically almost equivalent.
* Potassium chloride - white/lavender
* * Potassium and calcium chlorides are both natural body electrolytes, but... potassium at least is a cardiac electrolyte; overdoses can stop the heart.  The intravenous lethal dose is 10 times less than the oral... but I still would try to avoid swallowing.
* Sodium chloride - banana (really too much like ordinary firebreathing, though...)
* Lithium chloride - fuscia!  Nice picture at the [LithiumStove](LithiumStove.html) page.
* * [Lithium toxicity summary](http://risk.lsd.ornl.gov/tox/profiles/lith.shtml)
* * Great 'Nordic Expert Group' document on [health risks of lithium compounds](http://www.bostoncoop.net/~mike/ah2002_16.pdf).

## Sparkles

Everything comes in different mesh sizes - which make a big difference.  It's easier to get lots of smaller stuff up in the air - but bigger particles will billow for half a second after the flame has died out - a great effect.  Mixes are good.

* [Magnesium](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/ranchfire3/IMG_1839.vhtml).
* * Magnesium likes to react!  It'll pull the oxygen out of water to oxidize itself, creating heat - which can be bad - and hydrogen - which likes to explode.  It will slowly oxidize in plain water - leaving hydrogen bubbles.  In other situations, it'll oxidize very quickly!  It's <b>bad news</b> with boric acid solutions - no sparkles with the lime green.  Copper chloride will also catalyze it - I found out the hard way that if it's mixed (dry) with copper chloride hydrate, it reacts vigorously when shaken.
* * Fine magnesium reacts faster.
* * Fine magnesium on skin + liquid soap (before water) = thermal burn.  Very strange!
* * Magnesium (and many other metals, especially titanium) will 'go bad' over time; they'll develop an oxide coating and refuse to burn if left open for any time at all, and especially if even a drop of water gets in the container.
* * I've heard (and believe) some concern that powdered Mg may create free radicals in the body.  Eat your vitamin C.
* Steel - I need a good shot of this!  Branching yellow sparks.
* [Iron](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/dorkbotfire/DSC02024_1.vhtml).
* [Titanium](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/ranchfire3/IMG_1842.vhtml)  Crackly white sparks.
* * Lots of titanium is an alloy that contains vanadium, which is cumulative, turns your tongue green/black, and is bad for you!
* [Carbon](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/dorkbotfire/131_3156_cropped.vhtml).  Floating post-blow [spark-mushrooms](http://www.monkeyview.net/id/545/dorkbotfire/131_3162.vhtml).
* Aluminum (A bust.  But if it's useful, here's a [health overview.](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs22.html))  I've had some luck with dark aluminum, but no firebreathing data yet.
