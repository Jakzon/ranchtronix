I used one type of fuel tank for Betsy

<big>Portible Marine Fuel Tanks</big>

These are tanks designed for use on small motor boats.  

The tank is made out of polyethlyne.  I did a lot of whinging over fuel tanks before selecting these.  For various reasons I wanted a metal tank but non were really to be found.  I believe that boaters have had many of the same problems.  Eventually they all seem to have settled in polyethlyne as the proper materal for fuel tanks.

These tanks have a couple of problems when used for Betsy.  The main one is that they are small and they have a dip tube for withdrawing fuel.  The tube is 1/4" which makes it hard to pump a lot fuel out of the tank.  They also don't store well.  I had much trouble with priming the pumps when using these tanks.

<big>Polyethlyn Water Tanks</big>

These may be the solution.  They are square, and have large drain ports on the bottom of the tank.  You can get them in sizes up to 100 gallons.
