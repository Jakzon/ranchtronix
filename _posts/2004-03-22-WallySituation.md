Wally Situation.

Otherwise know as pulling a Wally.  From when Wally Glen disconnected a propane hose from a propane canon that was under pressure.  Since the disconnect didn't have a check valve on the plug end, propane gas began pouring back out the plug causing a bit of a panic.

Hssssss.... shit shit shit!
