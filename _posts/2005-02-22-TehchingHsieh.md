Tehching Hsieh is a performance artist based in New York City. Born in Taiwan in 1950, Hsieh studied painting, film, and photography until his obligatory military enlistment in 1970. He came to NYC in 1974. His performance art consists of five one-year performances followed by a final, 13-year performance. Hsieh uses his own life as a medium for his work.
