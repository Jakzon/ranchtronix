We've been thinking about starting a [CraftTronix](CraftTronix.html) night on Mondays, and a [GetShitDoneTronix](GetShitDoneTronix.html) night on Sundays.  But mang thinks maybe make [CraftTronix](CraftTronix.html) a monthly or wheneverly on Wednesdays, and keep Monday for werky werk.  It would be hard to make a weekly interesting each week.

Some ideas for [CraftTronix:](CraftTronix:.html)

* blinky clothes
* jewelry
* pottery
* woodworking

Lots of reprints of old metalworking books here: [http://lindsaybks.com/prod/index.html](http://lindsaybks.com/prod/index.html)
