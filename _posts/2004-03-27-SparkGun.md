Deets!

Cp of air                              0.244 BTU/lbm-deg F. 
Heat needed to vaporize the alcohol:   39.6 btu/lbm
Air in 1 lbm fuel-air:                 0.9

Solving for the temperature rise if we ad 39.6 BTU/lbm to the air before it is mized we get

     39.6/.9/.244 == 180 deg F temp rise.

Thus we need to heat the air around 200 deg F in order to fully vaporize the alcohol.
