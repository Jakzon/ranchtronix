Ideas:

* RF tx/rx should use preamble/id
* * especially useful in case others are on the same frequency (hopefully they aren't broadcasting all the time)
* use some kind of Manchester encoding
* * software? get some encoding modules?
* * self-clocking protocol?

RF TX:

* AVR
* ISP header
* TX module
* antenna
* 16MHz xtal + caps
* knobs
* sliders
* battery pack

RF RX:

* AVR
* ISP header
* RX module
* antenna
* 16MHz xtal + caps
* DMX hardware
* battery pack
