<big>Ignitors</big>

There are several types of ignitors used for pyro machina

Electric: 

There are lots of these.  Most furnaces, and many propane torches use these, either as  piezo electric or electronic sparkers.

For a lot of applications these don't seem to work too well.  In theory you only need a small spark to ignite a prefect mixture for fuel and air.  In practice it is hard to get the right mixture of fuel and air where you want it when you want it.

Propane Torch:

Works, tends to blow out.

Propane torches use a high pressure jet of propane to draw in and mix air in a venturi.  The problem is that any distrubance will tend to change the ratio of propane to air and can cause the flame be blow out.

Propane Wick:

Better than a torch, this design uses a stainless steel wick to hold a propane flame.  

Downside is that like a torch it continuously consumes propane.  Unlike a torch the flame is 
yellow which may or may not be a problem.

Flares:
