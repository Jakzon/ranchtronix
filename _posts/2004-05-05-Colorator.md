WTF is a Colorator?

The small idea behind a colorator is a container filled with granular salts.  A stainless steel screen holds the granules in place while acohol is pumped through the container.  The salts then disolve in the alcohol.

The reasoning is that it might be possible to build these cheaply (ha) and use them to add colorants to alchol just before it is pumped into a flame cannon.  This is good because salts are corrosive.  If the fuel tank plumbing and pump are not exposed to the salts then they can be made of common materials like steel, brass and such and are therefor much cheaper.

Ordered an inline strainer.  Will see if this can be turned into something that will allow me to disolve salts in alcohol.

Another though is to use a small tank of water and Strontium Chloride and pump it into the flow just before the alcohol enters the launch system.  The base idea is that [SrCl](SrCl.html) maybe much more soluable in water than alcohol.  Enough so that I can add 25 grams of the stuff in water and still have a flamable mixture of methonol + water + [SrCl.](SrCl..html)  For this I need solubility data for [SrCl.](SrCl..html)

Dah Source!

Calcium Chloride    60g/100ml    (0.6)  
Lithium Chloride    64g/100ml    (0.64)
Potasium Chloride   35g/100ml    (0.35) 
Sodium Chloride    209g/100ml    (2.09) 
Strontium Chloride 106g/100ml    (1.06)

Boric Acid          4.8 g/100ml  (0.05) <--- This is not so good!
Copper Chloride     .62 g/100ml  (0.01)
Copper Acetate      7.2 g/100ml  (0.07)

I've read that adding 50grams of colorant per gallon (3785ml) of alcohol is a good rule of thumb.  In that case 
the ratio of colorant to alchol is (0.013).

Waving my hands.  Any colorant that has a solubility of more than 13.0g/100ml in water can be used in a aqueous
solution injection system.  That tends to rule out Boric Acid, which is very sad!
