WTF is a Colorator?

The small idea behind a colorator is a container filled with granular salts.  A stainless steel screen holds the granules in place while acohol is pumped through the container.  The salts then disolve in the alcohol.

The reasoning is that it might be possible to build these cheaply (ha) and use them to add colorants to alchol just before it is pumped into a flame cannon.  This is good because salts are corrosive.  If the fuel tank plumbing and pump are not exposed to the salts then they can be made of common materials like steel, brass and such and are therefor much cheaper.

Ordered an inline strainer.  Will see if this can be turned into something that will allow me to disolve salts in alcohol.

Another though is to use a small tank of water and Strontium Chloride and pump it into the flow just before the alcohol enters the launch system.  The base idea is that [SrCl](SrCl.html) maybe much more soluable in water than alcohol.  Enough so that I can add 25 grams of the stuff in water and still have a flamable mixture of methonol + water + [SrCl.](SrCl..html)  For this I need solubility data for [SrCl.](SrCl..html)
