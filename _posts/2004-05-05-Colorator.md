WTF is a Colorator?

The small idea behind a colorator is a container filled with granular salts.  A stainless steel screen holds the granules in place while acohol is pumped through the container.  The salts then disolve in the alcohol.

The reasoning is that it might be possible to build these cheaply (ha) and use them to add colorants to alchol just before it is pumped into a flame cannon.  This is good because salts are corrosive.  If the fuel tank plumbing and pump are not exposed to the salts then they can be made of common materials like steel, brass and such and are therefor much cheaper.
