## Blowers
----
<big>First Blower</big>

I have been using a small 25 cuft/min blower that I bought from Surplus Center.  It's a small plastic centrifugal blower.  Unfortunately is is now not working because it got over loaded with titanium dust.

<big>Turbo Charger</big>

I bought a turbo charge off of ebay.  Buys said the turbine was a bit cracked.  I have disasembled it and pulled out the compressor.

The compressor is about 2 inches in diameter.  Full speed rpm for this turbo charger is maybe 30-40,000
rpm.  However that is at a large boost over several psig.  I only need 5 inches at most.  Rough calculations seem to indicate that a small fractional hp dc motor running at 3000-5000 rpm should be enough to provide the pressure boost I need.

Blower has a .25 inch shaft.  Thus I need a small dc motor of about 1/8 to 1/4 hp to run it.
