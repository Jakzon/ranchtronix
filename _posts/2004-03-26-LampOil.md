Lamp oil can be used for fire spinning.  Can be kind of hard to light, especially when cold, so a good lighter is a good idea.  You can also mix in some white gas to get things going easier.

Can also be used for firebreathing.  If so, you probably want to make sure you get one with as few additives as possible.
