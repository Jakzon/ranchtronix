I've used two types of fuel pumps for Betsy.

Holly Fuel Pump

Max Pressure: 14psig
Flow Rate:    2 gpm max

Little Giant Magnettic drive pump
Larger Little Giant Magnetic drive pump

A problem with the first pump was not enough low rate and a sensitivity to crap.  
A problem with all of these are that they need to be primed.  This is a problem.

<big>Double Diaphram Pumps</big>

A potential solution would be to use a air operated diaphram pump.  These produce good flow rates on the order of 4-6 gpm max at decent pressure.

Interesting Deets:

1) Self priming?
2) Can tolerate crap (1/32 diameter crap is no problem)
3) High Pressure, will pump up to 100 psig (same as air pressure used to operate the pump)
4) Good flow rate small pumps will pump 3-6 gpm.
5) Cheap, small pumps run $190 clams.
6) Good for Chemical transfer.
7) Low air consumption, 1-6 scfm.

Example.

A yammaha DP-10

Explanation of points.

1) Self Priming is good.  Often there is a need to setup and take down these systems.  Pumps that require priming _realy_ dislike air in the lines.  Self priming pumps can pump air through if need be. (I had lots of problems with priming the holly fuel pump and the chemical pumps)

2) Tolerate crap.  This is important cause the playa is a dirty enviornment.  Another reason would be so that I can mix carbon poweder with the alcohol, this would produce floaty sparks after the main fire ball.

3) High Pressure.  High Pressure is good because it means that pump can force the fuel to flow through small fuel lines, check valves and such.  The previous pumps suffered because there flow rate dropped off quickly as the head pressure went up.  Diaphram pumps should be able to keep a high rate of flow reguardless.

4) Good flow rate.  The current restriction on Betsys firing rate the the length of time it takes to fill the launch tube.  Curently it take 45 seconds to fill it.  At a real 5 gpm it sould only take six seconds to fill the tube.

5) Cheap is best cause I'm not made of money.

6) Pumps are made of PFDV or some such.  This is compatible with methonol, alcohol and gasoline.  And compatible with almost all colorants that I would want to use.

7) Low air consumption.  Units require 1-6 scfm or air.  This is low enough that I may be able to use the nitrogen tank operate the pump.  Power for the centrifical pumps has been a real problem.  The large pump I bough last summer won't run off the inverter I have.
