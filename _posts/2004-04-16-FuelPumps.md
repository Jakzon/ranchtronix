I've used two types of fuel pumps for Betsy.

Holly Fuel Pump

Max Pressure: 14psig
Flow Rate:    2 gpm max

Little Giant Magnettic drive pump
Larger Little Giant Magnetic drive pump

A problem with the first pump was not enough low rate and a sensitivity to crap.  
A problem with all of these are that they need to be primed.  This is a problem.

A potential solution would be to use a air operated diaphram pump.  These produce good flow rates on the order of 6 gpm
max at decent pressure.  They may also be self priming.  A potential problem is that they like the holly fuel pump probably dislike crap in the fuel.

Another advantage of these pumps is that it may be possible to run them off of the nitrogen supply.  A yammaha DP-10

Seems to run between 2 and 8 scfm.  I think a 80 cuft nitrogen tank will run one of these for 5-10 minutes of pumping.
Dats 30 gallons worth of fuel.  More than enough for a single showing.
