Gear Linky:

* Circuit Cellar project using AVR, RF module, encoder/decoder[here](http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/print/0102/millier/index.asp) - use of Manchester encoding with AM link seems like a good idea
* Example design using those Laipac modules with a PIC to add smarts [here](http://www.siliconchip.com.au/cms/A_30806/article.html) - no listing of the interesting manchester encoding/CRC/error correction routines
* [Digital PLL](http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/phy-pages/dpll.html) - used to regenerate clock from received signal
* [Manchester encoding using RS232 for Microchip PIC RF applications](http://www.quickbuilder.co.uk/qb/articles/)
