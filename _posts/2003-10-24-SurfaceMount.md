Surface mount can be less hassle than through-hole, especially for parts with lots of pins.

Some useful parts:

* [Atmel ATTiny26](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=2967) - nice little AVR that comes in 20-pin SOIC. $2.58 from Digikey [ATTINY26-16SC-ND](http://www.digikey.com/scripts/us/dksus.dll?PName?Name=ATTINY26-16SC-ND&Lang=1)
* [Identification Pictures for SMD](http://www.geocities.com/vk3em/smtguide/smtpics.htm) - nice set of pics of common packages.  Shows the relative sizes.
* [Dan's Small Parts](http://www.danssmallpartsandkits.net/) - has some SMD assortments at the bottom.  Haven't tried 'im.  Looks like some dude in his garage.
