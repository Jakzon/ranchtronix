Notes on breathing colored fire.

9/18/3

I heard from someone that might know that lithium combustion products may be carcinogenic.  I'm holding off on any further experimentsx until I can find out more...

8/22/3

I just got some new chemicals today, from Bryant Labratories in Berkeley.  Really nice, talkative guy behind the counter!

Today:

* Lithium chloride
* Lithium iodide
* Oxalic acid
* Acetic acid

I'm going to mess with the acids later, but I'll be trying the lithiums tonight...

First, are they toxic?  I think I'm OK wrt lithium, as it's prescribed to bipolar folks in gram doses, and I'll be absorbing at most milligrams.  Choride is in salt... how about iodide?

From [http://www.mythyroid.com/iodine.htm:](http://www.mythyroid.com/iodine.htm:)

In the event of the detonation of a nuclear weapon or the release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor, the most likely treatment of internal contamination would be the use of potassium iodide or iodate to prevent radioiodine from accumulating in the thyroid. The recommended daily dose of potassium iodide is 130 mg for adults, 65 mg for children 3 to 18 years old, 32 mg for children 1 month to up to 3 years old, and 16 mg for infants less than 1 month old. Potassium iodide must be taken shortly before exposure or within several hours after exposure to be effective. Both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the FDA have approved the use of potassium iodide in emergencies. Potassium iodide is widely available through the mail and the Internet. Too high a dose will result in iodism, but the risk of serious side effects with the recommended dose is extremely small.

I think I'll be OK.

First tests!

Lithium iodide is bitter as hell.  Lithium chloride just tastes salty.  Lithium chloride is moderately exothermic when hydrating - it made the alcohol hot when I mixed it.  Both show color, but the chloride shows it much better.  Pretty good color on breathing fire, and good color on the torch itself, but the color is FANTASTIC on steel wool.  Deep deep fuschia.

I might need to retire the potassium!
