Betsy is a FKO Device that I made for that thing in the desert.  Above is a washed out picture of it being fired with Gasoline in 2001.  In 2002 I fired it with Strontium Chloride and Methonol and Boric Acid and Ethonol.  Both produced pretty red and green fire balls.  Somewhere in my stuff is a good picture of the red fire ball.  Will upload when I run across it.
