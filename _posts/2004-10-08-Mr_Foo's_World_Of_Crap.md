## Mr Foo's World of Crap
----

Yes thatz right!  Mr Foo has vast amounts of crap cluttering up dah ranch that he neither wants nor can use!  All this crap can be yours for a song and maybe a soft shoe.  No hell with that, I don't need your old shoes.  Can't sing?  Then I'll take money!

Important: This stuff is crap because I don't need it.  Everything works just fine unless otherwise noted.
