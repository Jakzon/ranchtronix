## Repository for PCB board files

<b>A CVS server would be better!</b>

### AAA booster.  Very much in progress

upload:AAA%20booster.zip

### Off-if-light-on-but-slowly-when-dark board for octopi, with voltage regulator and resistor arrays to assist ballasting LEDs.

Not so simple :)

upload:Simple%20dimmer.zip (not yet)

### Voltage regulated PIC chip design

Fabricated but untested.

upload:V%20regulated%20pic.zip (not yet)
