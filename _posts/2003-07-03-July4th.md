I'm not sure this original message went out to everyone, so here it is 
again, plus some updates:

Please bring some firewood.  I'll bring some sort of burn barrel thingy.  

Please remember to police your camp well before you leave.

Blair says the playa is really dusty this year, but the weather is glorious, 
and hot, but not too hot.  

MOTA, Mona, Bryan and Dennis each appear to be headed out 
Wednesday morning.  As Dennis suggests: 
"I shall leave from work Wednesday evening - ... And is"the grader" still 
around ? I don't remember seeing it for a couple of years. How about 
directions on the grader (if it's there) and if not then at the base of those 
BLM signs just as you drive onto the playa at the 12 mile exit?

And so we don't get confused and follow some other group's directions - 
let's proactively identify our directions as being to:
PASTOR DODGER'S DESERT BIBLE STUDY

Looks like we have a race between Mona, Mota and Me...
I remember the grader being gone also...
So how about this...
Whoever is first...
"PASTOR DODGER'S DESERT BIBLE STUDY"Put directions on the 
grader (if it is there)
otherwise, put directions on the BACK of the [BlackRockCity](BlackRockCity.html) playa ramp 
sign.

General directions (paraphrased from Dodgers post):take 12 mile ramp 
following track along the NW edge of the playa (towards Solders Meadow)
When the Black Rock is due East (there may be a pole/tower still there) 
turn East and head for the (wait for it) Black Rock.
[take care to look for wet spots]
About 2-5 miles before the Black Rock should be the place.
About:
GPS40°54'42.8" -119°06'11.2" - BURNINGMAN 96
or a little North and East of there.
