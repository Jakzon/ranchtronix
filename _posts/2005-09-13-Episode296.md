## Prologue
IRA GLASS: Ok, in the coming weeks and months we are all going to be hearing so much about Hurricane Katrina, and why the government's response was so abysmal. And already the blame-shifting is like this prizefight that is already in its third or fourth round. Already we have heard officials try to shrug off any attempts at accountability by saying that it too soon, by saying that they are not going to play the blame game. And before the million details and arguments and counter-arguments start to make all of our heads woozy, I would just like to repeat here something that was talked about very briefly this week. One of those things that seems so fundamental, that seems to cut through a lot of the debate that is happening and end it definitively.
