## Prologue
IRA GLASS: "Ok, in the coming weeks and months we are all going to be hearing so much about Hurricane Katrina, and why the government's response was so abysmal. And already the blame-shifting is like this prizefight that is already in its third or fourth round. Already we have heard officials try to shrug off any attempts at accountability by saying that it too soon, by saying that they are not going to play the blame game.  

And before the million details and arguments and counter-arguments start to make all of our heads woozy, I would just like to repeat here something that was talked about very briefly this week. One of those things that seems so fundamental, that seems to cut through a lot of the supposed debate that is happening and end it definitively. It's so much so. that when I would see people on TV posturing and trotting out their talking points I kept wanting to go back and say no no no no no no don't forget this thing. 

It has to do with the biggest argument out there right now. Whether the federal government was supposed to be in charge of rescuing people and getting food and water and all that into New Orleans. It has come up a lot. Like when the head of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff was asked by Tim Russert on Meet The Press, "Since you knew the storm was coming, why didn't you get busses and trains and planes and trucks in there to evacuate?" Chertoff said it wasn't his job. 

[1:05]

CHERTOFF: "Tim, the way that emegency operations act under the law is the responsibility and the.. the power, the authority rests with state and local officials."

[1:20]

IRA GLASS: "This idea that is was state and local officials who were the ones that blew it, not the feds, this idea is all over the place. From the talking heads on TV, to Rush Limbaugh...

[1:30]

RUSH LIMBAUGH: "What we had down there was an eminent(?) failure of state and local government. We had incompetence in the mayors office, incompetence in the governor's office."

IRA GLASS: And sure, it is clear, even this early, that there are plenty of things that state and local government did to screw things up. But here's this thing that I read this week, this thing that I kept thinking about all week. It really comes down to a couple of basic facts. The governor of Louisiana declares a state of emergency the Friday before the storm hits, right? Calls on the federal government to step in. Then President Bush officially declares a state of emergency in Louisiana the next day, Saturday before the storm, and authorizes the Federal Emergency Managment Agency to act. You can read the paper where he does this on the White House website. Basically, that should have settled who was in charge. 

[2:17]

WILLIAM NICHOLSON: "After that happened, there was plenty of authority. There was all the authority in the world."

IRA GLASS: "We checked out this idea that from that point the Federal government was, in fact, in charge. We checked that out with several different experts and consultants on these issues this week, and they all agreed that the law is unambiguous. But this particular guy is William Nicholson, author of the books "Emergency Response" and "Emergency Management Law and Homeland Security Law and Policy". And if you are into Homeland Security policy you might want to check those out. 

He says that once the governor asked for help and the President declares a state of emergency, the Feds basically have the broad powers to do what is necessary. And he says, even if the president hadn't declared a state of emergency, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Chertoff, could have acted. There's this whole new-fangled way for him to take emergency powers under something called the National Response Plan.

WILLIAM NICHOLSON: "Well, basically the way it works is the Secretary of Homeland Security designates this as a catastrophic incident and federal resources deploy to preset federal locations or staging areas and, so they don't even have to have a local or state declaration in order to move forward with this."

IRA GLASS: "In other words, it doesn't matter what the governor says, it doesn't matter what the local people say. Basically once that happens they can just go ahead and do what needs to be done to fix the problem."

[3:40]

WILLIAM NICHOLSON: "That's correct. It's utterly clear that they had the authority to pre-position assets and to significantly accellerate the federal response. 

IRA GLASS: And they didn't need to wait for the state?" 

WILLIAM NICHOLSON: "They did not need to wait for the state."
