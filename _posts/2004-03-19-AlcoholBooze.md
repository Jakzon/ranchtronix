Alcohol Info

Typical Properties: [AlcoholProperties](AlcoholProperties.html)

Alcohol is interesting because it burns with a dim flame and therefor can be used to make colored fire.  Fuels like gasoline and desmell produce a flame rich in soot (carbon dust) which emits black body radiation (broad spectrum) which washes
out the color.

Many Salts will disolve in alcohol.

Methanol burns with an almost invisible flame making it excelent in colored fire applications.  However it is toxic and can will cause blindness (by making the optic nerves swell).  In particular it can be absorbed through the eyes!  Yikes.

Ethanol because it has two linked carbon atoms produces a brighter flame.  But has the advantage of being non-toxic.
