## The Rules:
# Please don't bring your [ObTainium](ObTainium.html) to [RanchTronix!](RanchTronix!.html) We don't want your crap! List it here instead!
# [No one wants your crappy CRT monitor!](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&from=R3&siteid=0&query=monitor&category2=27179) Ignore Rule #1 and bring it to the ranch; raj will take it in for recycling for you!
# We have too many crappy TVs at [RaNChtronIx!](RaNChtronIx!.html) [Just put it out on the street in SF and it will be gone in minutes.](http://www.craigslist.org/zip/)
# Crappy crappy crappity-crap!!!

## Stuff from Raj that can be picked up at [FooManor:](FooManor:.html)

* Anti-glare/ELF/VLF radiation-reducing filter for 17" computer montior. Why the hell did I buy this?
* External SCSI cd-burner. I took an internal Philips burner and put it in an external case. I forget if the internal burner was an IDE or SCSI device. I think it's 8x write. Whateverr.
* Humidifier. I needed this for my dank Pittsburgh apartment. That apartment sucked so much. This thing might be good if your house gets dry in the winter.
* <s>NetGear RT314 4-port router/gateway. If you have a cable modem, you might want one of these! It has a great firewall, NAT, and port forwarding.</s>
* Stuff not claimed by Dec 1 will be donated to [BernalHeights](BernalHeights.html) senior center.
