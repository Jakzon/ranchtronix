Goal:

* find press about donations for 9/11 going into the general fund

Summary:

It looks like Dr Healy, the head of the fund at the time, created the Liberty Fund specifically for 9/11 donations.  This actually went '''against''' the Red Cross practice of putting donations into the general fund (this got heat after a 1998 earthquake).

Not clear yet whether Liberty Fund was intended to be for general use or just 9/11.
