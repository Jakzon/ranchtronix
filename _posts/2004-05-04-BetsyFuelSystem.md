I have aquired a yammah dual diaphram pump.

[http://www.yamadapump.com/pages/products/dp-10.html](http://www.yamadapump.com/pages/products/dp-10.html) 

This pump runs off of 100 psig compressed air.  Supposedly it can pump upto 6 gpm.  And can pump up to 100 psig.  The wetted arts are all polypropaline and PTFE.  Should be able to handle anything thrown at it.

The hope to is that the large head that this pump can handle also means that the flow rate is insensitive to small flow restrictions.  Flow restrictions have been the bane of Betsys pumps, causing excesive fill times.  The other problem has been priming.  As this pump is supposed to be self priming to 10 feet there should be no problems.
