# PCB Drive By

* intro to circuit boards
* schematic capture
* board layout
* fabricating a board using homebrew techniques you can use on the floor
* how to send a board out to be professionally fabricated
* quick introduction to using surface mount parts

## Intro to Circuit Boards

* differences between breadboard, veroboard, wirewrap and printed circuits
* advantages/disadvantages of PCBs

## Schematic Capture

* Eagle is insane (but consistently so)
* finding parts in libraries
* connecting parts
* create your own part

## Board Layout

* transferring from schematic to board
* setting board size
* placing components
* drawing wires (circuit traces)
* layers (top, bottom, soldermask, silkscreen)
* layout tips
* * good sizes for pads and holes
* * manipulating grid
* * ground plane (fills)

## Fabricating Your Board

* homebrew techniques
* Gerber file format
* using the [SparkFun](SparkFun.html) CAM script
* * slight modifications by Nick
* panelizing
* Design Rule Check (DRC)
* * using freedfm.com
* * using Eagle
* some online fabricators
* * BatchPCB
* ** [http://www.batchpcb.com](http://www.batchpcb.com) (SparkFun front end to Gold Phoenix, $10 + $2.50/in, no minimum)
* * Gold Phoenix
* ** [http://www.goldphoenixpcb.biz/](http://www.goldphoenixpcb.biz/) ($120, 155sq in, multiple jobs on one panel)
* * Custom PCB
* ** [http://www.custompcb.com/](http://www.custompcb.com/)


## Surface Mount Soldering

* you can do it
* watch Nick solder!
