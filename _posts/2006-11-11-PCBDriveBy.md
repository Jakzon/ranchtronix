# PCB Drive By

* schematic capture
* board layout
* fabricating a board using homebrew techniques you can use on the floor
* how to send a board out to be professionally fabricated
* quick introduction to using surface mount parts

## Schematic Capture

* Eagle is insane (but consistently so)
* finding parts in libraries
* connecting parts
* create your own part

## Board Layout

* transferring from schematic to board
* setting board size
* placing components
* drawing wires (circuit traces)
* layers (top, bottom, soldermask, silkscreen)
* layout tips
* * good sizes for pads and holes
* * manipulating grid
* * ground plane (fills)
