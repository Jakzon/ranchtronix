The Mini disco is a back-packable mechanical disco ball, with lights, contained within a snow globe and uses a 4 "C" battery pack power source.

* Version 1 of the mini disco has LED track lighting, using 2 brass wires and resisters soldered at each LED site.  Voltage divider wireing was used for the motor, along with a 100 ohm pot, to allow change in speed of the disco ball from "Gabber" to "Barry White." 

* Version 2 the motor is now controlled with a 1K pot hooked up to a circuit board with a voltage regulator and diode.  The LED's are wired for connection to an AVR Ass Butterfly for throbby capability

* *Problems with the AVR heating and not all of the lights lighting up.  Raj suggests: "Yup, sound like your LEDs were connected directly to the micro! Gerneral practice is to use something like the ULN2003 darlington drivers, cause the AVR can't source that much juice!"
