Anybody know of a good translucent slightly flexible plastic to use?  Anyone tried this [clear polymelt](http://www.artstuf.com/DStock.fm$RETRIEVE?SKU=MC-1195&html=display) from [DouglasAndSturgess?](DouglasAndSturgess?.html)

From a medical-oriented [site](http://www.devicelink.com/mddi/archive/96/04/011.html):<br>
In general, each type of resin has its own distinct advantages. Epoxies are ideal for high temperatures (up to 450Â°F), or for highly corrosive applications. For example, formulations of epoxy are used when steam sterilization is essential. Polyurethanes are an excellent general-purpose material for both soft-rubber and hard-plastic applications where exceptional toughness and wear resistance are important. They are used routinely in devices where blood and patient contact is expected. Silicones are best for product applications that require rubber that is soft or of medium hardness over a broad temperature range.
