So the idea of a color rator....

The basic idea is to pump alcohol through a device where it will disolve matal salts in enough quantity to produce a colored flame.

This may not be that hard.  The alcohol has to disolve at most 50 grams per gallon of salt.  This is maybe a teaspoon
worth.

Hmmmm....
