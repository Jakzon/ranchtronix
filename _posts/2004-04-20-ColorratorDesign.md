## Colorrator
----

So the idea of a colorrator....

The basic idea is to pump alcohol through a device where it will disolve matal salts in enough quantity to produce a colored flame.

This may not be that hard.  The alcohol has to disolve at most 50 grams per gallon of salt.  This is maybe a teaspoon worth.

What looks like a good solution is to use an industrial filter as the basis for a colorator.

These are made of polypropylene and are rated for 125 psig.  Filters with 20X20 mesh size are availible.

The 1/2 inch size has 2 psig pressure drop at 5 gpm which is okay when used with a diaphram pump.

Cost is about $30 clams each.
