## Bugs and Stuff
----

* 11/10/04:
* * Did not real software work other than checking in the code
* * Think that overshoot problem could be helped greatly by adding D to PI to get PID
* * Think that the blower is very laggy due to the mass of the rotor.

* 11/08/04:
* * Found and fixed serious bug in median filter that was clobbering memory (Mr Foo <-- was smoking crack)
* * Serious overshoot on turn on, why?  fix how?  (tunning maybe?)
