![cb-1.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cb-1.jpg)

Built only in 1989 and 1990.  Apparently in Japan there is/was some weird licensing/insurance jump at 400cc, so this guy is 399cc with lots of go.  Redline is 13,500 RPM!

Already done modifications:

* braided steel brake lines
* front fork from F2
* larger back tire
* 49 state head
* jetting (actually not sure, but looks like there's the remains of a kit in my box of stuff)
* Chafong clip-ons
* Mtec headlight bulb replacement (brighter but could be brighter still)
* new mirrors

Intended modifications:

* custom sheet metal chain guard

Maybe modifications:

* brake light modulator
* Luxeon brake lights
* Luxeon running lights
* reflective tape on forks and side panels
* louder exhaust (ideally louder at low rpms, quieter at high rpms)
