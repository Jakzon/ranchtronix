If any of these are actually possible, please let me know!

* in new object list, should be able to type full name, not just first character
* in new object list, scroll wheel should work when focused on category list
* keyboard accelerator for "Save As"
* cut and paste from Max window
* ability to make Max window stay on top
* U hop when wires cross over each other but aren't connected like in a schematic (or change colours)
* show object description in new object list
* way to increase font size in help patches (teeny tiny on my 14" 1400x1040 laptop screen)
* * rescaling of pixel image (not just text) would be nice
* make resize handle target area larger
* escape key to dismiss inspector dialog
