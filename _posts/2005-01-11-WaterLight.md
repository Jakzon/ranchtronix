Luxeon LEDs + switches + water bottle = pretty rippling colours

The three colours are offset from each other and create pretty shadows of additive colour.

Each colour is on a simple mechanical switch so you can choose any combination of red, green and blue.  In a future version each colour will be on a dial to control the intensity.
