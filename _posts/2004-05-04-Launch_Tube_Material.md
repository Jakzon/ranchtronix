title: Launch_Tube_Material
---

Materials that we want to launch out of the tube.

Salts
:Strontium Chloride:
:Boric Acid
:Sodium Chloride
:Lithium Chloride
:Copper Chloride
:Copper Acetate
:Potasium Chloride
:Calcium Chloride

Powders
:Magnesium
:Carbon Powder
:Titainium Powder

Fuels:
:Methonol
:Ethonol
:Gasolina


The problems that we may have with this is that many of these materials are corrosive.  Oddly enough CPVC plastic can deal with all of these with no problema.  Problem is I dislike the idea of making the launch tube out of plasitca.

Materials to be considered.

#Stainless Steel
#Hastalloy-C
#Copper
#Chrome Plated Bronze
