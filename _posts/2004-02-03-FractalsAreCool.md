Check out three-dimensional quaternion fractals [here](http://www.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/phy11733/index_e.html).  You can use [Quat](http://www.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/phy11733/quat_e.html) to compute them.  The obvious thing to do is write a script to generate successive images and string them together in a movie.

mang, have you seen this?
