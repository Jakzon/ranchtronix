<blockquote>
I got a new senior coconut release today. SMOKE ON THE WATER. yes! deep
purple. I'm not kidding. I haven't heard it yet, but it's bound to be
epic. I also noticed that there was another whole SC album with
"inspirational" music... basically gospel, from the song titles and album
design.
