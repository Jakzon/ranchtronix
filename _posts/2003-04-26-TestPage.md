Trying to add an html tag: <a href="http://www.ranchtronix.net">ranchtronix!</a>

Yet again: [RanchTronix](RanchTronix.html)

Why did that work? [RanchTronix](RanchTronix.html) and Ranchtronix (without a capital T) should be two different pages. However, this wiki is running on a Mac OS X machine with a HFS+ file system, which is not case sensitive. So [RanchTronix](RanchTronix.html) actually resolves to a valid page, which is good, because that's an easy way to create a link to the home page. 

Also, [KrazyKringle](KrazyKringle.html) resolves, even though Mr. Kringle's user name is actually Krazykringle. The [KrazyKringle](KrazyKringle.html) page hasn't been created yet, so it might be hard to see what i'm talking about.

But since we are on a  case-insensitive file system, just typing AsS or NiX or [FiRe](FiRe.html) would create a link to the Ass, Nix, or Fire page, although doing so would be [UgLy](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UgLy). Note that wikis generally capitalize the first letter of any page you create, whether you want to or not (unless [FreeUpper](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FreeUpper) is set to zero).

I don't think that using a case-insensitive file system is going to be a problem, but we could  always switch to the UFS file system, or someone could buy me a FreeBSD machine :)

Wow!  It's just like typing!

I have a bunch of wire and some parts that RAnchTronix may be interested in... perhaps an <b>"Obtainium"</b> page would be useful- yes?
