### [Bottom of the Hill](http://bottomofthehill.com/)
Ethan IM'ed me this review:
    Raj:   then i realized that bottom of the hill has a patio..
    Ethan: oh, that's ture.
    Ethan: but it's rarely pleasant.
    Ethan: it's frequently packed thick out there
    Ethan: at least during crowded shows.
    Ethan: like the barbecue shows. mmmm....
    Ethan: have you been to an all-you-can-eat bbq show there?
    Ethan: nothing better in this world.
    Ethan: the problem with the bbq show i went to (american analog set was headlining) was that the bbq line was so long, every time they brought burgers out they were gone by the time i noticed, got in line, and got to the front of the line.
