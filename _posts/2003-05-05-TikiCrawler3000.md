## Progress Report!!

'''24July2003'''

## [TikiCrawler3000](TikiCrawler3000.html) version 2.0 is born on 18July on 2Cow Playa!!!

'''13July2003'''

Got the Honda 1KW generator today :)


'''11July2003'''

I ordered some big-ass solenoid relays (200A!) so hopefully soon we will have forward <i>and</i> reverse.  200A is in fact probably overkill, but that's the way we do it. (mang)

'''07July2003'''

## [TikiCrawler3000](TikiCrawler3000.html) version 1.0 is born on 4July in [BlackRock!!!](BlackRock!!!.html)

Mr Foo is my hero!


'''01July2003'''

The motor, she runs!

'''27June2003'''

I think it's gonna be hard to find a relay that can do 275A at 24-36VDC at short notice.  Starting to think that recovering the forward-neutral-reverse control from the old golf cart and prodding it mechanically (linear actuator?) might be the way to go.  Will make fail-safe a bit harder. (mang)

'''25June2003'''

[BattleBots](http://www.battlebots.com/download/BattleBots_Tech_Regs_v3.1.pdf) requires use of FM/PPM or FM/IPD for their lightweight class and FM/PCM in their heavier classes.  We should consider upgrading to FM before that event in the desert, although if we process the servo signal using an AVR we can potentially do a fail-safe in software.

'''22June2003'''

While at the [summer solstice bbq](http://www.subcarrier.org/mang/pics/solsticebbq/) the hammock frame collapsed under a load of only 5 people!  Need to figure out some way of reinforcing the beams.

Foo's current plan for the frame involves two large water pipes with the hammock frame connected by U-bolts.  The whole thing should disassemble and be transportable by car.

'''16June2003'''

Measurements from RC receiver (when trimmed to center):

* center 1.35ms
* left .9ms
* right 1.8ms

Measurements from Linear Actuator:

* 0 -> 5.47Kohms (zero all the way in)
* 9.9Kohms -> 4.45Kohms (9.9KOhms all the way in)

'''4June2003'''

We are now in possession of the linear actuator and big motor speed controller!  The next step is to make a control circuit that takes the output of the RC receiver module and positions the linear actuator correctly.


'''16May2003'''

Yesterday we got the RC transmitter, receiver module, and electronic speed control!


'''14May2003'''

Yesterday we procured the golf cart, hammock, and hammock frame. The hammock holds six people, all smooshed together :)

# ideas

## front steering mechanism

* [A primer on Ackermann steering](http://www.mech.uq.edu.au/courses/mech3100/chap13/s1.htm)
* [More on Ackerman](http://www.rctek.com/handling/ackerman_steering_principle.html)
* [steering parts](http://www.jackssmallengines.com/gocartparts_index.html)

One idea is to use a huge servo. Here is a sail winch servo that costs $70<br>

Another idea is to use hydraulic actuators. My friends Chris and Mahesh at CMU turned an Polaris ATV into a military robot

### motor controller and wiring

* Our motor controller [Golf Tech Curtis 1204 275 amp](http://www.golftechonline.com/C1204.asp)
* 1204 specs and wiring diagram [here](http://www.curtisinst.com/Uploads/DataSheets/1204.pdf)
* 12VDC 40 & 70A relays for golf cart use [here](http://www.sourceresearch.com/nte/r51.cfm) - cheap but we need more amps
* White-Rodgers DC power contactors [here](http://www.white-rodgers.com/homeowner/ptech/relays/relay_06.htm)
* White-Rodgers Model# 586-914 - [datasheet](http://www.white-rodgers.com/pdfs/sell_sheets/R-4005web.pdf) [$58 at Allied Electronics](http://www.alliedelec.com/catalog/catalogpages/2002/714.pdf?Catalog=2002&PageNum=714)
* * rated for 200A on NO contacts, 100A on NC

### batteries & charging

* the micro closest to the battery could monitor voltage to provide estimated run time and warn (buzzer) when too low
* [charging batteries in series/parallel](http://batterytender.com/faqs.php/#15) - parallel should be okay (lots of other good stuff there too)
* Charger - DLS45   12 volt,  45 amp, 7"x6.75"x3.75", 7 lbs $155 [here](http://www.kansaswindpower.net/batteries,_chargers.htm)
