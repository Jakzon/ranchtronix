Ordered a bunch of boards from them.  Had three separate 1"x1.25" designs which they combined (+$8 per extra design).  Depanelizing cost $0.50/board.  Got soldermask both sides.  Received 24 boards at total cost ~$4/board.  It took them a week and a half to ship (had to ping them -- they forgot about order?) but after shipping the boards they arrived in three days (from Malaysia via Alaska).  The boards are nice and would use again.
