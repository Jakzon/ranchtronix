I think there are three or four things a beginner (or anyone new to
our site needs to know before venturing out). When I see folks I
don't recognize (or people inflating their kite from underneath and
dragging it right-side-up along the path to the point), I try to
gently determine if they're "up to speed".

1) Must have a working kite leash that fully depowers the kite. Must
know how to use it. Must be willing to use it - and be able to do so
quickly. No point in fighting your kite in a tug of war as it swings
through the rest of the kiters on launch - with the lines somewhere
at neck level. I've actually debated with beginners more than once
about whether it would be OK to go out without a working kite leash
just this once (on their first visit to the site - in powerful and
gusty conditions) - the correct answer in my opinion is "no".

2) Rocks are hard, deceptively stationary, and all way around our
site (including the back side of the beach near the parking lot).
Don't go on or near the rocks with your kite flying. If you aren't
going to make the beach, release your kite (see item 1) 1000' (3 kite-
line lengths) before you get to the rocks. Reel it in (only one line
tight), and walk up the rocks like a civilized person (I prefer the
leading edge deflated).

3) Know how to self rescue. I frequently see people swimming their
kites in when their kites could be pulling them in. When I get to my
downed kite I find it easiest to lay right on the middle of my
leading edge, bend the L.E. in half, an then work my way to the
tips. Holding the kite tips will drag me in (about 45 degrees
downwind either way). Holding on to the last two struts with my
right hand (top), and elbow (bottom), is much easier. You could read
a book or catch a nap while coming in this way. In any case, try to
do what you can to keep your lines and board from trailing
significantly behind.

4) Offshore winds and ebb tides can leave you bobbing around the bay
for a long time. If everthing looks GREAT and most of the hotshots
are on the beach looking out at the water - there's probably a
reason - right? Ask yourself (or them) what it is.

So maybe one more just to round it out:

5) When you hook in - you're responsible for your safety and your
equipment (i.e. other people's safety). If someone launches or lands
you poorly, you picked the wrong assistant, or didn't have good
communication with them (in my opinion). You pick (and preflight)
the gear, you pick the conditions, and you pick your assistants.
Finally, if things go wrong it's likely to be YOU that gets injured.

So these are my top safety items for newbies. If you think I got them
wrong, or there are other items please chime in.

Also, if you have tips you can offer (like how to return a board to a
downwind kiter, how to relaunch - or NOT relaunch a downed kite...)
please let us all know.
