## Tronix source repository

We have a [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org) source repository.

It can be viewed on the web at [http://svnhosting.org:8000/websvn/listing.php?repname=ranchtronix](http://svnhosting.org:8000/websvn/listing.php?repname=ranchtronix).

To check it out, you'll need a subversion client.

* [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) for Windows - it integrates with the windows shell.
* * To check out the repository, (after installing and restarting,) right click in the folder you want to create it in and choose 'checkout...'
* * Enter 'http://svnhosting.org:8000/svn/ranchtronix/' in 'URL of Repository'
* * In the directory that's created, right click on anything for lots of options.

* The command-line 'svn' client.
