Sequencer circuit board during final assembly.  The AVR microcontroller uses a darlington transistor array to control 8 separate EL-wire drivers.  I was responsible for all design and construction of the sequencer.

Sequencer circuit board mounted in plastic enclosure.  EL-wire driver outputs are connected to the EL-wire mounted on the plywood using computer CAT-5 cables.  The exposed terminals make debugging much easier.  Laptop is used to re-program the sequencer to display different animations.

Completed sign mounted on the Ambulance.  The sequencer is mounted in lightbar on top.  At night the rough edges are invisible.
