The Ambience Ambulance creates a sanctuary from the often challenging environment of Burning Man by providing a temporary space for relaxation and chill.  It moves to a different location each night and can be found by its distinctive exterior lighting.  For 2002 and 2003 I designed, built and programmed two sequencers to animate the lightbar and large "Ambience Ambulance" sign.

Sequencer circuit board during final assembly.  The AVR microcontroller uses a darlington transistor array to control 8 separate drivers for the strands of electroluminescent wire (EL-wire).  I was responsible for all design, construction and programming of the sequencer.  The software was written in Basic using BASCOM-AVR.

Sequencer circuit board mounted in plastic enclosure.  EL-wire driver outputs are connected to the EL-wire mounted on the plywood using computer CAT-5 cables.  The exposed terminals make debugging much easier.  Laptop is used to re-program the sequencer to display different animations.

Completed sign mounted on the Ambulance.  The sequencer is mounted in lightbar on top.  At night the transparent plastic overlay is invisible.

The illuminated sign during testing.  Each oval and word can be individually controlled by the software allowing for animated patterns.
