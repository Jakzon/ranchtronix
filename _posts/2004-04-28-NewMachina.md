Parts for a New Betsy

Increase the holding capcity to 1 gallon.  Make everything of stainless.

<big>Launch Tube + Nozzle</big><br>

The launch tube can be made of 304L stainless.  I would consist of a 1-1/2 inch diameter nozzle, a 2" dia 6 foot luanch tube.  The back end of the launch tube would then be reduced to 1" through a coupling, then feed into a tigh 1" dia u bend.  At the end of the u-bend a 1" diamet socket weld to 1" NTP coupling.

Parts:<br>
Item  Qty   Description
  1    1   2" Stainless Steel Pipe 72 inches, Sch 10<br>
  2    1   2-1.25" Reducing Coupler Butt-Weld, Sch 10<br>
  3    1   2-1"  Reducing Coupler, Sch 10<br>
  4    1   1" 304L Threaded Stainless Steel Pipe, Sch 40<br>
  5    1   1.25 inch nipple 6 inches long, Sch 10<br>
  6    3   1/2" Threaded 304L Stainless Steel Pipe Nipple, Sch40?

These parts will need to be carefully butt welded together to make the launch tube.  This may require a skilled welder.  Pay for with mucho beer.  

The 1" diamet pipe needs to be bent into a u-bend.

Main Launch Valve:<br>

valve need a high CV and the ability to withstand alcohol and metal salts.  A valve with Buna N seals and a stainless steel body would be best.

Qty(1)   1" pilot operated valve.<br>

Pressure Tank:<br>

Betsy uses a 3ft section of black pipe capped at both ends as the pressure tank.  The main requirement for the tank is that the capsity needs to be on the order of the size of the launch tube.  In this case 1 gallon.  A stainless steel tank with a 1" port would be prefered.  Possibly a small fire extenguisher tank.

Qty(1)   ???

<big>Safety System</big>

The following parts are needed.

<big>Fuel System<br>
Qty(1)   Dual Diaphram Pump 6pgm<br>
Qty(1)   20 feet 1" dia fuel hose?<br>

Qty(1)   1" coupler stainless.  (May Have)<br>

<b>Pressure System</b><br>

Qty(1)   80 cuft nitrogen tank.  (Note CO2 might work fine in this app because "carbonization of the fuel" isn't a problem with this design.
Qty(1)   High flow regulator.  Remains to be seen if the regulator that I have can be used.
Qty(1)   Pressure relief valve.  150 psig.
