Parts for a New Betsy

Increase the holding capcity to 1 gallon.  Make everything of stainless.

Launch Tube + Nozzle<br>

The launch tube can be made of 304L stainless.  I would consist of a 1-1/2 inch diameter nozzle, a 2" dia 6 foot luanch tube.  The back end of the launch tube would then be reduced to 1" through a coupling, then feed into a tigh 1" dia u bend.  At the end of the u-bend a 1" diamet socket weld to 1" NTP coupling.

Parts:
Qty(1)   2" Stainless Steel Pipe 72 inches, Sch 10<br>
Qty(1)   2-1.25" Reducing Coupler Butt-Weld, Sch 10<br>
Qty(1)   2-1"  Reducing Coupler, Sch 10<br>
Qty(1)   1" 304L Stainless Steel Pipe, Sch 40<br>
Qty(1)   1.25 inch nipple 6 inches long<br>

These parts will need to be carefully butt welded together to make the launch tube.  This may require a skilled welder.  Pay for with mucho beer.
