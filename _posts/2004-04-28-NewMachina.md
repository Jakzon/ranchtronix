Parts for a New Betsy

Increase the holding capcity to 1 gallon.  Make everything of stainless.

<big>Launch Tube + Nozzle</big><br>

The launch tube can be made of 304L stainless.  I would consist of a 1-1/2 inch diameter nozzle, a 2" dia 6 foot luanch tube.  The back end of the launch tube would then be reduced to 1" through a coupling, then feed into a tigh 1" dia u bend.  At the end of the u-bend a 1" diamet socket weld to 1" NTP coupling.

Parts:<br>
Item  Qty   Description
  1    1   2" Stainless Steel Pipe 72 inches, Sch 10<br>
  2    1   2-1.25" Reducing Coupler Butt-Weld, Sch 10<br>
  3    1   2-1"  Reducing Coupler, Sch 10<br>
  4    1   1" 304L Threaded Stainless Steel Pipe, Sch 40<br>
  5    1   1.25 inch nipple 6 inches long, Sch 10<br>
  6    3   1/2" Threaded 304L Stainless Steel Pipe Nipple, Sch40?

These parts will need to be carefully butt welded together to make the launch tube.  This may require a skilled welder.  Pay for with mucho beer.  

The 1" diamet pipe needs to be bent into a u-bend.
