Parts for a New Betsy

The basic idea is to increase the holding capcity to 1 gallon.  And to make the launch tube and ascociated components out of a material than can handle alcohol and alkali metal salts.

Launch Tube Material Notes: [Launch Tube Material](Launch_Tube_Material.html)<br>

Launch Tube Design Notes: [Launch Tube Configation](Launch_Tube_Configation.html)<br>

Nickel Plated Launch Tube [Nickel Plate](Nickel_Plate.html)

Currently thinking about either using a long 2" diameter launch tube or a twin 1.5" diameter launch tube.

These parts will need to be carefully butt welded together to make the launch tube.  This may require a skilled welder.  Pay for with mucho beer.  

If a 2" diameter design is used then a 1" diameter pipe will need to be bent into a 5 inch u-bend.

Main Launch Valve:<br>

Valve needs a high CV and the ability to withstand alcohol and metal salts.  A valve with Buna N seals and a stainless steel body would be best.  Failing that a chrome plated brass valve might work ok.  A 3/4 inch valve seems to be okay for the current design.  If the diameter of the launch tune is increased then the valve size needs to be increased.

    1   3/4" 12V Solenoid operated pilot valve.<br>

Pressure Tank:<br>

Betsy uses a 3ft section of black pipe capped at both ends as the pressure tank.  The main requirement for the tank is that the capsity needs to be on the order of the size of the launch tube.  In this case 1 gallon.  A stainless steel tank with a 1" port would be prefered.  Possibly a small fire extenguisher tank.

These guys might be able to make a tank
